# Example Output Artifacts (qualitative inspection)

This folder provides a **small subset of representative output artifacts** generated by the experimental pipeline.
The goal is to allow readers to quickly verify the expected **artifact contract** (HTML/PNG outputs) without uploading all outputs for every seed.

## Files in this folder

### France mobility (example outputs)
- `france_mobility_dec2020.html`  
  Interactive December mobility map (HTML).
- `france_mobility_map_matrix.png`  
  Multi-panel mobility change matrix visualization (PNG).
- `france_mobility_line.png`  
  Monthly trend line plot (PNG).

### US county mortality (example outputs)
- `covid_senior_scatter.png`  
  Association plot between elderly share and COVID-related outcome (PNG).

### NC population exposure (example outputs)
- `nc_population_hist.png`  
  Histogram/summary visualization for exposed population analysis (PNG).

## Notes
- These artifacts are included for **inspection and verification** only.
- The full evaluation uses per-seed logging in `logs/runs_20260131_171928.csv`, including an `artifacts_ok` flag to confirm whether all required outputs were produced for each run.
- If you rerun the notebook, you may generate additional artifacts (e.g., maps/figures) depending on the case definitions and configured outputs.
  
## Full artifacts (Google Drive)
GitHub web upload enforces a 25MB per-file limit; therefore, this folder contains only a representative subset for quick inspection.  
The full artifact bundle required for complete auditing (HTML/PNG outputs across cases/seeds) is available at:
